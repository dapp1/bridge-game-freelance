## About project
#### The project required one additional mini-game and support for other mini-games. An endless runner minigame was added, featuring a bridge, obstacles, and sticks to help you complete the bridge without falling into the abyss. Other minigames also required improvements or fixes, which I successfully completed.

## About minigame
#### The player swims along the river, collecting coins to advance to the next minigame. Obstacles appear along the way; if they hit them, the game is lost. The player must collect planks to cross the bridge and continue collecting coins.
#### When the player crosses a bridge, the next section of the path becomes more difficult, the number of required planks increases and the number of obstacles increases.
